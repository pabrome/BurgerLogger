# BurgerLogger

Welcome to the burger logger! Eat your hearts desire with this burger application, which allows you to add any burger of your choice and then Devour it. 

To use the app, simply type in the burger you wish to create and click "Log". The burger will move up to the left hand side with a "Devour" button next to it. Clicking the button will eat the burger and move it to the right side, which is the burger graveyard. The application saves your fresh burgers and the ones you've eaten.
